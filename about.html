  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>
    At <strong>Kenya MMF Calculator</strong>, our mission is to make it easy for Kenyan investors to
    understand and compare <em>Money Market Funds (MMFs)</em>. Too often, investors struggle to find
    clear information on returns, fees, and differences between providers.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we built this calculator. A simple, free, and transparent tool designed
    specifically for the Kenyan market. Whether you are just starting out or already investing,
    our platform gives you the ability to estimate your returns in seconds.
  </p>

  <h3>What We Offer</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Accurate return calculations based on current MMF rates</li>
    <li>Side-by-side comparisons of top providers such as Cytonn, Gulfcap, Etica, Kuza, and Lofty Corban</li>
    <li>Simple explanations to help beginners understand MMFs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>
    We believe every Kenyan should have access to tools that make financial decision-making smarter.
    By helping investors compare MMFs easily, we aim to promote financial literacy and empower people
    to grow their wealth with confidence.
