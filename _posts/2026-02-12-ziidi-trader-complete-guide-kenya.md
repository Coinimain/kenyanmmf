Just day after the launch of **Ziidi Trader**, interest in the new Ziidi Safaricom product has surged. We will explore how Ziidi Trader works in this article, and other important aspects of the new stock trading platform.

For the first time, millions of Kenyans can buy and sell shares listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) directly inside the M-PESA app. This marks a structural shift in retail investing.

But before placing your first trade, you need to understand:

- How does Ziidi Trader work
- Whether you need a CDS account
- How pricing and order matching function
- What risks are involved
- How it compares to money market funds
- Whether it is suitable for beginners

This is the complete 2026 guide.

## What Is Ziidi Trader?

Ziidi Trader is a stock trading platform embedded within the M-PESA app under Financial Services. It allows eligible M-PESA users to:

- Buy NSE-listed shares
- Sell listed shares
- Invest in corporate bonds
- Monitor portfolio performance
- Receive dividends directly via M-PESA

Ziidi Trader operates under oversight of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), ensuring regulatory compliance and investor protection.

It builds on Safaricom’s expanding Ziidi investment ecosystem, which previously introduced:

- Ziidi Money Market Fund (MMF)
- Ziidi Shariah investment option

Ziidi Trader extends that ecosystem into listed equities and bonds.

## How Does Ziidi Trader Work?

This is one of the fastest-rising searches in Kenya.

Here is the process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Activation

1. Open the M-PESA App  
2. Select Ziidi Trader under Financial Services  
3. Accept terms and risk acknowledgment  
4. Complete identity verification  
5. Confirm with your M-PESA PIN  

You must be 18 years or older and a registered M-PESA user.

---

### Step 2: Placing a Buy Order

To buy shares:

- Tap Trade  
- Select the listed company  
- Enter quantity and price  
- Choose pricing method (Best Price or Own Price)  
- Confirm with M-PESA PIN  

Funds are reserved immediately.
Orders are matched on the NSE between willing buyers and sellers.

---

### Step 3: Order Matching

Ziidi Trader does not guarantee execution. Trades are executed only when:

- A buyer and seller agree on price
- The order is matched within market hours

Orders are “Good Till Day,” which means they expire at 3:00 PM (market close). If not fulfilled by 3:00 PM, Funds are automatically reversed to your M-PESA wallet.

---

## Do You Need a CDS Account for Ziidi Trader?

No.
This is one of the most important structural differences. Ziidi Trader uses an **omnibus account structure**.
Instead of each investor opening a personal CDS account:

- Safaricom works with a licensed broker (Kestrel Capital).
- Shares are held in a pooled CDS account.
- Individual ownership is recorded digitally within the app.

You still legally own your shares. However:

- Shares purchased via Ziidi Trader remain within the platform.
- They are not merged with shares in a separate CDS account.

## Ziidi Trader vs Traditional Brokerage

Traditional share investing required:

- Opening a CDS account
- Selecting a stockbroker
- Physical documentation
- Manual onboarding

Ziidi Trader removes these friction points.

However, it also centralizes execution through the app structure rather than giving direct broker-level access. For some investors, this is convenience, while for others, it may limit flexibility.

---

## Does Ziidi Trader Use USSD?

Currently, there is no Ziidi USSD functionality. Ziidi Trader is app-based, which aligns with Safaricom’s smartphone-first digital strategy. Trading functionality is optimized for the M-PESA app experience rather than USSD.

---

## Ziidi Trader App Features

Inside the app, users can:

- View listed NSE companies
- Place buy and sell orders
- Select pricing options
- Monitor portfolio value
- View corporate announcements
- Receive trade notifications
- Receive dividends via M-PESA

Everything is centralized within the M-PESA ecosystem.

---

## Pricing Options Explained

Ziidi Trader offers two pricing mechanisms.

### Best Price

- Buying: lowest seller price available
- Selling: highest buyer price available

### Own Price

- Buying: maximum price you are willing to pay
- Selling: minimum price you are willing to accept

Execution depends entirely on supply and demand.

---

## How Dividends Work

If you hold shares on the book closure date:

- You qualify for dividends.
- Dividends are paid directly via M-PESA.

This removes traditional brokerage payout delays.

---

## When Are NSE Markets Open?

Nairobi Securities Exchange trading hours:

Monday – Friday  
9:30 AM – 3:00 PM

Outside these hours, you can view your portfolio but cannot execute trades.

---

## Can You Lose Money on Ziidi Trader?

Yes. Share prices fluctuate based on:

- Company earnings
- Market demand
- Economic conditions
- Investor sentiment
- Corporate actions

Ziidi Trader does not guarantee profits. If you sell below your purchase price, you incur a loss. Investing in shares carries risk.

- Long-term investors
- Individuals comfortable with market risk
- Investors seeking dividend income
- Younger investors entering capital markets

It may not be ideal for:

- Short-term funds
- Risk-averse investors

---

## Risks Investors Should Understand

1. Market volatility
2. Execution risk
3. Behavioral overtrading
4. Concentration risk
5. Lack of diversification

Access to markets does not eliminate risk.

---

## Why Ziidi Trader Matters for Kenya’s Capital Markets

Ziidi Trader lowers structural barriers. With millions of M-PESA users, potential outcomes include:

- Increased retail participation
- Improved liquidity on NSE
- Expanded financial inclusion
- Higher public awareness of equities

However, financial literacy will determine long-term outcomes. Access is step one, Education is step two.
