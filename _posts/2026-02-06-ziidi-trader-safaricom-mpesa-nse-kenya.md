Safaricom’s **Ziidi Trader** represents a major shift in how Kenyans access the stock market. By integrating equity trading directly into **M-PESA**, the platform removes long-standing barriers that have historically limited retail participation on the **Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)**.

For the first time, buying shares can feel as familiar as sending money or paying a bill.

If you want the full step-by-step walkthrough (setup, fees, limits, and how the omnibus holding actually works), use the **[Ziidi Trader complete guide for Kenya](/blog/ziidi-trader-complete-guide-kenya/)**.

## What Is Ziidi Trader?

Ziidi Trader enables users to **buy and sell NSE-listed shares directly from the M-PESA app**. There is no separate trading app, no paperwork, and no traditional broker onboarding at entry level.

Users can:
- Browse listed companies
- Place buy or sell orders
- Pay directly from their M-PESA balance
- Track prices and portfolio value in real time

Trades are executed via licensed intermediaries using an **omnibus account structure**, where holdings are administered on behalf of users.

## Why Ziidi Trader Does Not Require a CDS Account

Unlike traditional brokerage platforms, Ziidi Trader does **not** require investors to open a personal CDS account during onboarding.

Instead, holdings are tracked internally within Ziidi’s system, while execution and custody are handled by regulated intermediaries. This removes a major friction point — broker selection, CDS registration, and paperwork — that has historically discouraged first-time investors.

## What Using Ziidi Trader Actually Feels Like

Onboarding takes only a few minutes. Users opt in via M-PESA, confirm basic income and employment details, accept disclosures, and begin trading immediately.

In one demonstration, a user invested **KES 300** purely to test the process. Funds were deducted instantly from the M-PESA wallet, the trade executed immediately, and confirmation delivered via the standard M-PESA PIN flow.

The experience feels closer to making a mobile payment than executing a traditional stock trade.

## Costs and Single-Share Trading

Ziidi Trader lowers the cost of participation by:
- Allowing **single-share trades**
- Showing **all fees upfront**
- Keeping absolute transaction costs low

A small trade of about **KES 300** resulted in a total debit of roughly **KES 322**, covering brokerage and statutory charges. While percentage costs are higher on small trades, the absolute shilling cost remains accessible.

Here’s the detailed breakdown of what makes up the charges: **[Ziidi Trader fees explained](/blog/ziidi-trader-fees-explained-trade-cost/)**.

## Ziidi Trader vs Other Digital Platforms

Ziidi Trader differs from **Dosikaa**, the trading platform developed by the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC).

Dosikaa typically requires:
- A personal CDS account
- A selected stockbroker
- Direct share ownership in the investor’s name

Ziidi Trader prioritizes **speed and accessibility**, while Dosikaa prioritizes **traditional ownership structures**.

## Risks Investors Should Understand

Ziidi Trader makes investing easier — **not safer**.

Stock prices can fluctuate immediately after purchase, and early users have observed small paper losses shortly after execution. Investors should research companies, avoid investing money they cannot afford to lose, and take a long-term view.
