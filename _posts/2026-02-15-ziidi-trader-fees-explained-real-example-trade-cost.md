Ziidi Trader has made it easy for Kenyans to place NSE buy/sell orders inside M-PESA.

But before you hit **Buy**, one thing matters:

**What does a Ziidi trade actually cost - in shillings?**

This post explains Ziidi Trader fees in plain English, with real examples and a simple break-even rule.

## Ziidi Trader Fees (What’s Been Indicated)

Ziidi Trader fees have been reported/indicated at around **~1.5% per trade**, described as an all-in fee that bundles typical brokerage and statutory charges.

Two practical points:

1) You pay a fee when you buy  
2) You pay a fee when you sell  

So your “round trip” cost is roughly **buy fee + sell fee**.

Always confirm the latest fee inside the official Safaricom Ziidi Trader FAQ or the in-app pricing screen.

## Real Example 1: Buying KES 5,000 Worth of Shares

Assume fee is **1.5%**.

- Trade value: **KES 5,000**
- Fee (1.5%): **KES 75**
- Total cost: **KES 5,075**

---

## Real Example 2: Buy at KES 5,000, Sell at KES 5,500

Assume you buy KES 5,000 worth of shares and later sell when the value is KES 5,500.

**Buy side**
- Buy value: 5,000  
- Buy fee (1.5%): 75  
- Total out: **5,075**

**Sell side**
- Sell value: 5,500  
- Sell fee (1.5%): 82.50  
- Net in: **5,417.50**

**Net result**
- Money in after selling: **5,417.50**  
- Money out when buying: **5,075**  
- Profit: **KES 342.50**

## The Break-Even Rule (Most Beginners Miss This)

If fees are ~1.5% each way, your round-trip fee is roughly:

**1.5% (buy) + 1.5% (sell) ≈ 3%**

That means your shares typically need to move **more than ~3%** for you to break even comfortably (before any price slippage).

Fees matter more for:
- small price moves
- frequent buy/sell activity
- short-term trading

Fees matter less for:
- long-term investing
- dividend holding
- gradual accumulation

Market momentum is also pulling more people into trading right now. As more counters push to new highs and social chatter increases, many first-time investors are testing Ziidi with small trades, which makes understanding total trade cost even more important.

---

## Why Fees Matter More When Everyone Is Trading

When trading activity rises, more beginners enter the market - and many start with small, frequent trades.  
That’s where fees quietly decide outcomes: if your round-trip cost is ~3%, small moves and rapid flipping become harder to profit from.

---

## “All-In” vs Traditional Broker Pricing (Why Ziidi Feels Cheaper)

Traditional stockbrokers often have:
- an all-in cost that can feel higher on small trades, and/or
- a minimum fee that makes tiny trades expensive.

Ziidi’s advantage is that smaller trades can remain practical.

---

## Are M-PESA Transfers Charged?

Ziidi Trader has been positioned as having no extra charge for moving funds between your M-PESA wallet and the Ziidi trading account.

So your main cost is the trade fee itself.

---

## Why Participation Is Rising (Market Momentum + Lower Friction)

When markets are moving, participation rises.

The NSE has been pushing to new highs, with a broad rally across multiple counters. As prices rise, more people look for a simple on-ramp to participate, and Ziidi reduces the usual onboarding friction.

Ziidi’s pilot started on **Feb 4, 2026**, which aligns with the timing of the recent surge in attention.

---

## Who Benefits Most From Ziidi’s Fee Setup?

Ziidi tends to fit best if you’re:

- investing long-term and not flipping daily
- building positions gradually
- targeting dividend income alongside growth
- starting small while learning market mechanics

If you’re trying to do rapid in/out trades for tiny moves, the ~3% round-trip break-even rule will work against you.

---

## Final Thoughts

Ziidi Trader’s big story isn’t only that you can trade in M-PESA.

It’s that millions of Kenyans can now place NSE orders with simplified pricing and low friction.

Key takeaways:

- Know your true trade cost
- Respect the ~3% round-trip break-even
- Trade during market hours
- Start small, then scale with experience
