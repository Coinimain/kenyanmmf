  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

  <h3>1. In Kenya's MMFs, is compounding done monthly?</h3>
  <p>
    Interest in MMFs accrues daily, not monthly. The rate you see (for example, 13% per annum)
    is annualized, but funds calculate returns on a daily basis. Compounding is therefore
    effectively daily, with returns credited monthly.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Are fees deducted monthly or annually?</h3>
  <p>
    Management fees are prorated daily and deducted before returns are credited.
    This means the published yield is usually net of fees, but before withholding tax.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Is the highest rate always the best?</h3>
  <p>
    Not always. A higher rate may come with higher risk, lower liquidity, or operational issues.
    Always consider the provider’s reputation, stability, and withdrawal terms.
  </p>

  <h3>4. How much tax is charged on MMF returns?</h3>
  <p>
    In Kenya, interest earned from Money Market Funds is subject to a 15% withholding tax,
    which is applied when returns are paid out.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Are there penalties for withdrawing monthly?</h3>
  <p>
    Most MMFs allow free monthly withdrawals. However, some funds may limit the number of
    free withdrawals or charge small administrative fees. Always review the fund’s terms.
  </p>

  <h3>6. How do MMFs compare to banks or SACCOs?</h3>
  <p>
    MMFs typically offer higher returns than bank savings accounts and greater liquidity
    than SACCO fixed deposits. They are regulated by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) in Kenya.
