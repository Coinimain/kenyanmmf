    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    
    <h3>1. In Kenya’s MMFs, is compounding done monthly?</h3>
    <p>
      Interest in MMFs accrues daily, not monthly. The rate you see (e.g., 13% p.a.)
      is annualized, but funds calculate it on a daily basis. Compounding is effectively
      daily, with returns credited monthly.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Are fees deducted monthly or annually?</h3>
    <p>
      Management fees (e.g., 2% p.a.) are prorated daily and deducted before returns
      are credited. This means the published yield is usually net of fees, but before
      withholding tax.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Is the highest rate always the best?</h3>
    <p>
      Not always. A higher rate may come with higher risk or less liquidity.
      Always compare the provider’s reputation, stability, and withdrawal terms.
    </p>

    <h3>4. How much tax is charged on MMF returns?</h3>
    <p>
      In Kenya, interest earned from MMFs is subject to a 15% withholding tax,
      applied when your returns are paid out.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Are there penalties for withdrawing monthly?</h3>
    <p>
      Most MMFs in Kenya allow free monthly withdrawals, but some may impose limits
      (e.g., one free withdrawal per month) or small admin charges. Always check the
      fund’s terms.
    </p>

    <h3>6. How do MMFs compare to banks or SACCOs?</h3>
    <p>
      MMFs usually offer higher returns than savings accounts, and more liquidity
      than SACCO fixed deposits. They are also regulated by the CMA in Kenya.
